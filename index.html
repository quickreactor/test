A few well-curated, ready-to-go ingredients such as our grain and slaw mixes do make things more convenient in the kitchen, eliminating much of the chopping and longer cook times usually required. You just concentrate on making the yummy peanutty dressing, tossing the salad, frying the tofu and putting everything together at the end. Too easy.","image":"https://marleyspoon.com/media/recipes/64779/main_photos/medium/15_minute_satay_tofu-0bfbe06f3ad5bf8e1c0666a48881e6e6.jpeg","recipeIngredient":["200g coleslaw mix","40g peanut butter","240g mixed grains and seeds","coriander","1 zucchini","200g peanut satay tofu","1½ tbs neutral-flavoured oil","2 tsp soy sauce","3 tsp white vinegar","1 tsp Australian honey"],"name":"15-Minute Satay Tofu with Mixed Grain Slaw & Peanut Dressing","prepTime":"PT10M","recipeInstructions":"1.
